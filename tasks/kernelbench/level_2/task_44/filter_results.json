There are two consecutive `torch.mean(x, dim=[2, 3], keepdim=True)` operations. The first one already reduces the spatial dimensions (2 and 3) to size 1, so the second call is operating on dimensions that are already of size 1, making it redundant.\n2. After the two mean operations, the tensor has shape (batch_size, channels, 1, 1). Then `torch.mean(x)` is called, which could be done in a single operation.\n\nInefficient operations:\n1. The multiple mean operations could be combined into a single operation for better efficiency.\n2. The second `torch.mean(x, dim=[2, 3], keepdim=True)` is not only redundant but also inefficient as it's performing unnecessary computation.\n3. The final sequence of operations could be simplified to a single `torch.mean(x, dim=[1, 2, 3])` after the multiplication step.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###True###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###True###"
