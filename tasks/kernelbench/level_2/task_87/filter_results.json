These could be combined into a single subtraction: `x = x - (subtract_value_1 + subtract_value_2)`.\n\nInefficient operations:\n- The two separate subtraction operations create unnecessary intermediate tensors and computation steps. Combining them would be more efficient.\n- The function passes the convolution weights and biases separately instead of using a single Conv2d module, which could potentially benefit from optimizations in the PyTorch implementation.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###True###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###True###"
