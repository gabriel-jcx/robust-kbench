This could be combined into a single bias addition by adding the two bias terms together before applying them.\n\nInefficient operations:\n- Applying both `hardtanh` and `mish` activations in sequence is inefficient. The `hardtanh` function clamps values to a range, but then `mish` immediately transforms these values again. This means the `hardtanh` operation's effects are partially negated, making it redundant. Only the last activation function in a sequence has a meaningful effect on the final output.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###True###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###True###"
