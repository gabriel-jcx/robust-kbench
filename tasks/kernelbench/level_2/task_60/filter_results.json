Swish activation (sigmoid(x) * x)\n3. Group normalization\n4. HardSwish activation\n\nLooking for redundancies:\n- There are no duplicate computations\n- No operations that cancel each other out\n- No unnecessary intermediate variables or computations\n\nLooking for inefficiencies:\n- The code applies Swish activation followed immediately by HardSwish activation. This is inefficient because:\n  - Applying two activation functions in sequence is generally unnecessary\n  - The second activation (HardSwish) will override the effects of the first (Swish)\n  - This creates extra computation with no meaningful benefit to the model's expressiveness\n  - HardSwish is defined as x * min(max(x + 3, 0), 6) / 6, which will completely transform the output from the Swish activation\n\nThe sequential application of two different activation functions (Swish followed by HardSwish) is inefficient and unusual in neural network design. Typically, only one activation function would be used at each stage.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###True###"
