There are two consecutive LeakyReLU operations with the same negative_slope parameter (0.01):\n```python\n# LeakyReLU\nx = F.leaky_relu(x, negative_slope=0.01)\n# LeakyReLU\nx = F.leaky_relu(x, negative_slope=0.01)\n```\nApplying LeakyReLU twice in succession with the same parameters is redundant because LeakyReLU is idempotent for positive values and applies the same scaling to negative values. The second application doesn't change the output further.\n\n2. Similarly, there are two consecutive GELU operations:\n```python\n# GELU\nx = F.gelu(x)\n# GELU\nx = F.gelu(x)\n```\nGELU is not strictly idempotent, but applying it twice is redundant and inefficient. The second GELU will transform values that have already been transformed, which doesn't add meaningful processing.\n\nThese redundant operations waste computational resources and can slow down the model without providing any benefit to the model's expressiveness or performance.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###True###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###True###"
