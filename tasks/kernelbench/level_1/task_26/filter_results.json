A `forward_fn` function that simply applies GELU activation to an input tensor\n2. A `Model` class that takes this function as a parameter and applies it to the input\n3. A utility function `get_inputs` to generate random tensors for testing\n\nLooking at `forward_fn`, it's a straightforward wrapper around `F.gelu(x)`. There are no redundant operations here - it's a single function call with no unnecessary computations, temporary variables, or repeated calculations.\n\nRegarding efficiency, GELU is a standard activation function in PyTorch's functional API. The implementation is using the built-in optimized version directly without any custom implementation that might be less efficient. There are no inefficient patterns like unnecessary tensor copies, redundant calculations, or suboptimal tensor operations.\n\nThe `Model` class simply passes the input through to the function, adding no additional overhead.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
