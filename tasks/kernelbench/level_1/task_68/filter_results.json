It takes all the necessary parameters and passes them directly to the PyTorch function without any additional operations.\n\nThere are no redundant operations in this function - it's a direct call to the PyTorch implementation with all required parameters.\n\nThere are also no inefficient operations - the function doesn't perform any unnecessary computations, memory allocations, or transformations. It's a straightforward pass-through to the optimized PyTorch implementation.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
