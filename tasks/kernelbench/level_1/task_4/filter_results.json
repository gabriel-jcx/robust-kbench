The function contains only a single operation: `torch.matmul(A, B)`\n2. This operation is necessary to perform the matrix-vector multiplication\n3. `torch.matmul` is the appropriate PyTorch function for this operation\n4. There are no repeated calculations or unnecessary intermediate results\n5. The function doesn't contain any operations that could be combined or eliminated\n\nThe implementation is straightforward and contains only the essential operation needed to perform the matrix-vector multiplication. There are no redundant steps, and `torch.matmul` is an efficient implementation for this operation in PyTorch.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
