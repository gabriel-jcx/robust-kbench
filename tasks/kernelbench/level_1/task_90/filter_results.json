The function takes two arguments (the input tensor and the dimension) and directly passes them to the PyTorch function without any intermediate operations.\n\nLooking at the implementation:\n1. There are no repeated calculations\n2. No unnecessary tensor copies or conversions\n3. No redundant operations that could be simplified or removed\n4. The function uses the appropriate PyTorch primitive operation for the task\n5. There are no inefficient loops or operations that could be vectorized\n\nThe function is a minimal wrapper around a PyTorch primitive operation, making it both efficient and free of redundancy.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
