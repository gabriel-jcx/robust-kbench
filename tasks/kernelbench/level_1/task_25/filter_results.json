Computes the sigmoid of the input tensor `x`\n2. Multiplies the result by the original input tensor `x`\n\nLooking at this implementation:\n\n1. **Redundancy**: There are no redundant operations. Each operation is necessary for the Swish activation function, and no computation is performed multiple times unnecessarily.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: The implementation is efficient for what it's trying to accomplish. Swish activation is defined as x * sigmoid(x), and that's exactly what's being computed with no extra steps. This is the standard way to implement Swish in PyTorch.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
