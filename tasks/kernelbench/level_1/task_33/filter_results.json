The `forward_fn` function is a simple wrapper around PyTorch's built-in `F.batch_norm` function.\n2. It passes all parameters directly to the underlying function without any additional processing.\n3. There are no repeated calculations, unnecessary transformations, or redundant operations.\n4. The function uses the optimized PyTorch implementation of batch normalization, which is already designed to be efficient.\n5. All parameters are passed in the correct order and with appropriate naming.\n6. There are no unnecessary tensor allocations or conversions.\n\nThe function is a clean, direct call to the PyTorch batch normalization implementation without any additional overhead or redundant steps.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
