A `forward_fn` that performs a matrix multiplication between A and the transpose of B\n2. A simple `Model` class that wraps this function\n3. A utility function to generate random input tensors\n\nLooking at `forward_fn`:\n```python\ndef forward_fn(A: torch.Tensor, B: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    return torch.matmul(A, B.T)\n```\n\nThis function performs a single operation: matrix multiplication between A and the transpose of B. There are no repeated calculations, no unnecessary intermediate tensors created, and no operations that could be combined or eliminated.\n\nThe matrix multiplication with a transposed second argument is a standard operation and is implemented efficiently in PyTorch's `matmul` function, which uses optimized BLAS libraries under the hood.\n\nThe transpose operation `B.T` is lazy in PyTorch and doesn't create a new tensor - it just changes how the existing tensor is accessed during the matrix multiplication.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
