Calculates the Frobenius norm of the input tensor\n2. Divides the input tensor by this norm\n\nLooking for redundant operations:\n- There are no repeated calculations\n- No unnecessary intermediate tensors are created\n- No operations that cancel each other out\n- The function performs exactly what it needs to do without extra steps\n\nLooking for inefficient operations:\n- The implementation uses `torch.norm` with `p=\"fro\"` which is the standard way to compute Frobenius norm\n- The division operation is performed directly without unnecessary intermediate steps\n- The function is concise and uses appropriate PyTorch operations\n- There are no operations that could be combined or optimized further\n\nThe implementation is both minimal and efficient for the task of Frobenius normalization.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
