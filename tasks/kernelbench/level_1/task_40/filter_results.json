Extracts the normalized shape from the input tensor based on the weight tensor's shape\n2. Calls PyTorch's built-in `F.layer_norm` with the appropriate parameters\n\nAnalysis:\n- There are no redundant computations - each operation is performed exactly once\n- The function directly uses PyTorch's optimized implementation of layer normalization\n- The shape extraction is necessary to determine the normalization dimensions\n- All parameters are passed directly to the underlying function without unnecessary transformations\n\nThe implementation is clean and efficient, leveraging PyTorch's built-in functionality without adding unnecessary operations.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
