This is inefficient because:\n\n1. The `get_inputs` function already applies softmax to the predictions, making them valid probability distributions.\n2. Then `forward_fn` applies `torch.log()` to these probabilities.\n\nThis is inefficient because PyTorch's `F.kl_div` function has a parameter `log_target` that can be set to handle this situation more efficiently. The current implementation requires an extra computation step.\n\nAdditionally, the documentation for `F.kl_div` states that the input should be log-probabilities, so applying `torch.log()` to probabilities is the correct approach, but it could be done more efficiently by combining operations.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###True###"
