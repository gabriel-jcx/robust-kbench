Matrix multiplication: `torch.matmul(A, B)`\n2. Extracting the upper triangular part: `torch.triu(...)`\n\nLet's examine if there are any redundancies or inefficiencies:\n\n1. **Redundancy Analysis**:\n   - The inputs A and B are already upper triangular matrices (as stated in the docstring and generated in `get_inputs`).\n   - When multiplying two upper triangular matrices, the result is always an upper triangular matrix. This is a mathematical property.\n   - Therefore, applying `torch.triu()` to the result of `torch.matmul(A, B)` is redundant since the result is already upper triangular.\n\n2. **Efficiency Analysis**:\n   - The redundant `torch.triu()` operation adds unnecessary computation.\n   - However, there's another inefficiency: when multiplying upper triangular matrices, we can avoid computing the lower triangular part entirely, as those values will be zero.\n   - The standard `torch.matmul` computes the full matrix multiplication, including the lower triangular part that we know will be zero.\n   - A more efficient implementation would only compute the upper triangular elements of the result.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###True###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###True###"
