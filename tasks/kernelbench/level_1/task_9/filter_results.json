There are no redundant computations - it performs exactly one operation without any duplicate calculations or unnecessary steps.\n\nRegarding efficiency, `torch.matmul` is the standard optimized matrix multiplication operation in PyTorch. For the specific case of multiplying matrices where one is tall and skinny, this is an appropriate operation to use. The function doesn't contain any inefficient patterns like unnecessary data copying, repeated calculations, or suboptimal algorithm choices.\n\nThe function is minimal and directly uses PyTorch's optimized implementation for matrix multiplication, which leverages hardware acceleration when available.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
