This is a fundamental operation in PyTorch and is implemented efficiently. The operation is:\n1. Necessary for the function's purpose (matrix-scalar multiplication)\n2. Implemented in the most direct way possible\n3. Using PyTorch's optimized element-wise multiplication\n\nThere are no redundant operations - the function does exactly one thing and nothing more.\n\nThere are no inefficient operations - scalar multiplication in PyTorch is already optimized, and there's no more efficient way to express this operation.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
