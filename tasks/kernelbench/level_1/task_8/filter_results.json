A `forward_fn` that performs a single matrix multiplication using `torch.matmul`\n2. A `Model` class that simply calls the provided function (defaulting to `forward_fn`)\n3. A utility function `get_inputs` to generate random tensors of specified dimensions\n\nLooking at `forward_fn`:\n- It takes two tensors A and B\n- It performs a single operation: `torch.matmul(A, B)`\n- There are no repeated calculations\n- There are no unnecessary intermediate tensors\n- It uses the appropriate PyTorch primitive (`torch.matmul`) for matrix multiplication\n\nMatrix multiplication is a fundamental operation and `torch.matmul` is the optimized implementation in PyTorch. There are no redundant steps in this function, and it uses the most efficient operation available for this task.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###\n\nThe implementation is straightforward and optimal for the task of matrix multiplication. There are no redundant operations, and it uses PyTorch's optimized matrix multiplication function directly."
