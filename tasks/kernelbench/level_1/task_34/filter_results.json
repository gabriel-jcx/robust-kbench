It extracts dimensions from the input tensor\n2. Calculates mean and variance along spatial dimensions (H, W)\n3. Normalizes the input using the mean, variance, and epsilon\n4. Applies an affine transformation using weight and bias parameters\n\nLooking for redundancies:\n- There are no repeated calculations\n- No unnecessary intermediate variables\n- No operations that cancel each other out\n- The dimensions are used appropriately\n\nLooking for inefficiencies:\n- The implementation uses standard PyTorch operations\n- The reshaping of weights and biases with `.view(1, C, 1, 1)` is appropriate for broadcasting\n- The conditional check for weight and bias is efficient\n- The function avoids unnecessary memory allocations\n\nThe implementation is actually quite efficient and follows the standard approach for instance normalization. It doesn't have any obvious redundant operations or inefficient patterns. The code is concise and uses appropriate PyTorch operations.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
