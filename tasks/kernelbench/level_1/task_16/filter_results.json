The function takes two tensors A (shape K\u00d7M) and B (shape K\u00d7N)\n2. It transposes A (resulting in shape M\u00d7K)\n3. It performs matrix multiplication between A.T and B\n4. This produces a result of shape (M, N)\n\nThere are no repeated calculations, no unnecessary intermediate tensors created, and no operations that could be combined or eliminated. The function performs exactly one matrix multiplication with one transpose operation, which is the minimal set of operations needed to compute A.T * B.\n\nThe transpose operation is necessary for the intended calculation and cannot be eliminated. The matrix multiplication is implemented using PyTorch's optimized `matmul` function, which is the appropriate choice for this operation.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
