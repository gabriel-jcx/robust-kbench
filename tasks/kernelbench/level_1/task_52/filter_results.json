This is a direct call to a PyTorch primitive operation with no intermediate steps.\n\nLooking at the implementation:\n1. There are no redundant computations - the function makes a single call to `torch.argmin` without any duplicate or unnecessary operations.\n2. There are no inefficient operations - `torch.argmin` is an optimized PyTorch primitive that efficiently finds the indices of minimum values along a specified dimension.\n3. There is no unnecessary memory allocation or data copying.\n4. The function doesn't perform any operations that could be combined or optimized further.\n\nThe function is minimal and directly uses the appropriate PyTorch primitive for the task.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
