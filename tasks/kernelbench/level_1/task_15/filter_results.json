The inputs A and B are already lower triangular matrices (as specified in the docstring and confirmed in `get_inputs()`).\n2. When multiplying two lower triangular matrices, the result is always a lower triangular matrix. This is a mathematical property.\n3. The function applies `torch.tril()` to the result of `torch.matmul(A, B)`.\n\nSince the result of multiplying two lower triangular matrices is already lower triangular, applying `torch.tril()` to the result is redundant. It's performing an unnecessary operation that doesn't change the mathematical result but adds computational overhead.\n\nAs for inefficiency, the redundant `torch.tril()` operation is inefficient because it processes the entire matrix when we already know the result should be lower triangular. This is especially wasteful for large matrices.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###True###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###True###"
