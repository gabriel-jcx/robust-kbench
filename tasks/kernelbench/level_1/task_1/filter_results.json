A `forward_fn` function that performs matrix multiplication between two square matrices\n2. A `Model` class that simply calls the provided function (defaulting to `forward_fn`)\n3. A utility function `get_inputs` to generate random input tensors\n\nLooking at `forward_fn`:\n- It takes two tensors A and B\n- It performs a single operation: `torch.matmul(A, B)`\n- There are no repeated calculations\n- The matrix multiplication is implemented using PyTorch's optimized `matmul` function, which is the appropriate operation for this task\n\nThe `Model` class simply passes the inputs to the function without any additional processing.\n\nThere are no redundant operations (no calculations are performed multiple times) and the implementation uses the efficient built-in PyTorch matrix multiplication operation.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nINEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
