Extracts the normalized shape from the input tensor based on the weight tensor's shape\n2. Calls PyTorch's built-in `F.layer_norm` function with the appropriate parameters\n\nThere are no redundant operations here - each line serves a specific purpose and is executed only once.\n\nRegarding efficiency:\n- The function simply computes the normalized shape and delegates to the optimized PyTorch implementation\n- There are no unnecessary tensor operations, loops, or memory allocations\n- The shape extraction is a lightweight operation\n\nThe implementation is clean and directly uses PyTorch's optimized layer_norm implementation without any unnecessary steps.\n\nREDUNDANT_ANSWER: ###False###\nUNEFFICIENT_ANSWER: ###False###"
